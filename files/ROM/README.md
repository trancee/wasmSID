kernal.901227-01.bin		1994-06-11	8192
Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Revision 1.
This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the first revision of the Commodore 64
KERNAL. The RS-232 timing table is designed for exactly 1 MHz system
clock frequency, although no C64 runs at that clock rate. Unlike
later KERNAL revisions, this one does not detect the video system
(PAL/NTSC). This KERNAL was probably only used in early North
American Commodore 64 units.

This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the second revision of the Commodore 64 KERNAL.
It is the second most widely spread version.

kernal.901227-03.bin		1994-01-24	8192
Commodore 64 KERNAL ROM Revision 3.
This 8-kilobyte 2364 ROM is the third and essentially last revision of the
Commodore 64 KERNAL. It is the most widely spread version.
